## Recent ReSA Achievements
- Leading the development of a [research software funders community](https://www.researchsoft.org/funders-forum/) that has engaged 60+ funding organisations in its goal to address common challenges to achieve the significant cultural change needed across the research sector and better coordinate investment globally. See [Amsterdam Declaration on Funding Research Software Sustainability](https://adore.software/declaration/).
- Engaging in drafting of the [OECD Recommendation on Access to Research Data from Public Funding](https://www.oecd.org/sti/recommendation-access-to-research-data-from-public-funding.htm) and [UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science](https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation), which has led to the inclusion of research software in key international policy and [toolkits](https://www.unesco.org/en/open-science/toolkit-fostering-open-science-practices).
- Facilitating global [community forums](https://www.researchsoft.org/community-forum/) and discussions, supported by [analysis](https://www.researchsoft.org/resa-resources/) of relevant issues, to identify community priorities and create task forces on topics such as [research software policy for research institutions](https://www.researchsoft.org/software-policies/), and [research software authorship](https://www.researchsoft.org/tf-authorship-contribution/).
- Co-leading the drafting of the [FAIR for Research Software Principles](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01710-x) which engaged 500+ community members. [Positive signals of adoption](https://www.researchsoft.org/blog/2024-03/) demonstrate high levels of community support.
- Supporting the ReSA task force on [code availability by publishers](https://www.researchsoft.org/taskforces/) to engage publishers in the coordination needed to gain wide-scale cultural change.
- Co-leading initiatives in [Africa](https://www.talarify.co.za/2023/05/29/driving-sustainable-research-software-and-systems-insights-from-the-first-research-software-indaba-in-africa/) (with [Research Software and Systems Engineers Africa](https://rsse.africa/)) and Asia (with [Research Software Engineers Asia Association](https://rse-asia.github.io/RSE_Asia/)) to identify research software community leaders and influencers to help shape international dialogues.
- Providing [resources](https://www.researchsoft.org/resa-resources/) to raise awareness of the importance of software in research.
