**Resources for supporting policy change in research institutions in practice: A report from Subgroup 2 of the ReSA & RDA Policies in Research Organisations for Research Software (PRO4RS) Working Group**

June 2024

By Michelle Barker, Domhnall Carlin, Jeremy Cohen, Eric A. Jensen, Catherine M. Jones, Carlos Martinez Ortiz and Dan Rudmann

**1 Introduction**

Advocating for, initiating and supporting policy change can be a major challenge. This is especially true in large organisations with longstanding structures and complex operational models that have been established over, sometimes, many years or even decades. Even when the underlying landscape on which such structures are based has shifted, engendering change can still be a daunting undertaking.

As software has become an increasingly important element of research across almost all domains, there is a need for better recognition of the importance and value of software to modern research processes and outputs. This includes the need for research organisations to provide guidance and policies relating to research software, as part of the institutional change to more effectively support the sustainability and impact of research software that is now critical to the research enterprise. The [Policies in Research Organisations for Research Software (PRO4RS) Working Group](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/rda-resa-policies-research-organisations-research-software-pro4rs/posts/) is helping to support this shift by developing examples and recommendations for institutional policies.

This report presents one of the outputs of the [Policies in Research Organisation for Research Software](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/rda-resa-policies-in-research-organisations-for-research-software-pro4rs/members/all-members/) (PRO4RS) Working Group, which is co-convened by the [Research Software Alliance](https://www.researchsoft.org/) (ReSA) and [Research Data Alliance](https://www.rd-alliance.org/) (RDA). The report highlights the challenges that the working group is addressing and our motivation for looking at them. It then summarises a variety of existing resources relevant to different stakeholders.

**2 Challenges and Motivation**

There are many examples of how research software, and those who develop and maintain it, can increase research impact, including:

- [Research Software Engineering Accelerates the Translation of Biomedical Research for Health](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02353-0) by David Horsfall et al.
- [Better Research Software Tools to Elevate the Rate of Scientific Discovery -- or why we need to invest in research software engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03934) by Joran Deschamps, Damian Nogare and Florian Jug
- [Advocating for Equality of Contribution: The Research Software Engineer (RSE) (Heliophysics Decadal Survey 2024)](https://essopenarchive.org/doi/full/10.22541/essoar.167397417.74606224/v1) by Rebecca Ringuette et al.

This scholarship strongly demonstrates the benefits of research institutional support for this critical part of open science, alongside support from other parts of the research ecosystem. However, there are also many discussions on the need for institutional leadership to provide better support, including [The urgent need to make the value of open source visible and quantifiable to university leadership](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/post/20230801/) by Carlos Maltzahn. This reflects challenges such as the relative lack of existing policy-related activity in this space, and a lack of recognition or awareness of the need for policies relating to research software.

It is important to provide members of the research community with the opportunity to improve the quality of the software outputs in their institutions, and policy development and associated culture change is a key component in supporting this. The PRO4RS Working Group is also extending ReSA’s [list of policies](https://www.researchsoft.org/software-policies/) that support research software in research institutions, to provide a range of examples.

**3 Summary of key resources**

While policies on research software are still rare in research institutions, this is an area that is developing rapidly and there are already a number of related resources that can offer important input to the work being undertaken by the PRO4RS Working Group. The resources that have been collated in the table below include articles and reports relating to existing policy activities, research processes and guidance on supporting or raising awareness of policy, or policy-related developments. For each resource in the table below, a link to the content is included along with a brief summary of the key contributions offered by the resource. The main stakeholders who the resource is considered to be of use to are then highlighted.

| **Resource** | **Summary** | **Stakeholders** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Approaches to scaling up reproducibility in research organisations](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10663903) by Michelle Barker and Neil Chue Hong. 2024. | Whilst on reproducibility, the framework and guidance on how to influence change (summarised [here](https://zenodo.org/records/10664660)) could be applied to any topic, including developing research software policies. The framework focuses on meso-level factors, such as groups, organisations and communities, to understand the role of research organisations and the people within them. The framework can be used by a range of internal stakeholders with differing goals, such as institutional leaders seeking to align organisational strategies, or managers wishing to provide the support that staff in their part of the organisation may be seeking. The intention is also to enable dialogue between managers and researchers to create collaborative and sustainable solutions for a wider uptake of reproducible research practices. | Researchers, policy makers, research supporters (the framework had different levels, so it can be of use to stakeholders at those levels). |
| [Evaluate your RDM Offering](https://sparceurope.org/evaluate-your-rdm-offering/) by  Lauren Cadwallader, Alastair Dunning, Hardy Schwamm, Marta Teperek, Angus Whyte, Jonathan Rans. 2018. | This includes analysis of policy (and other areas) in an interactive online questionnaire that maps to a radar chart (downloadable at the end). | Policy makers in institutions, particularly universities that have research data management policy in place. |

**4 Conclusions and Next Steps**

The resources identified in this report provide a range of approaches targeted at a variety of different stakeholders. These various models/lived experiences represent different approaches to tackling or addressing similar challenges and it is recommended that stakeholders looking to implement or benefit from the resources highlighted here choose the model that works best for them and their situation.

A common thread in the resources is to identify a key success factor, and then to identify the target community/stakeholders to engage,  to enable organisational change. Policy is about setting out the expected behaviours that are going to be rewarded (or should be deprecated) and supporting the necessary shift through procedural and behavioural changes. If there isn’t any buy-in from stakeholders in these processes, then positive change won’t happen.

Following on from this activity to collate a set of resources, the outputs from Sub Group 2 detailed in this report will feed into PRO4RS Working Group Sub Groups 3 and 4 which will undertake an analysis of existing policies and identification of areas where policies are lacking, respectively. The resources collated in this report will help to better understand existing approaches to research software policy and ensure that the PRO4RS Working Group can effectively develop the planned case studies in Sub Group 5 which will ultimately help to increase adoption of policies within research institutions.
